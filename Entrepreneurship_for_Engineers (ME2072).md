Lean Startup is an approach that every aspiring entrepreneur should know about. In this video, I’ll present the 5 best takeaways (in my opinion) from the book that happens to have the same name – The Lean Startup, by Eric Ries.

How to start your first business: http://bit.ly/391czmD 

Top 5 takeaways from The Lean Startup:
0:00 Intro
01:12 1. The Build-Measure-Learn Feedback Loop
03:28 2. Everything is a Grand Experiment
05:21 3. Different Types of Mvps
07:24 4. The Three Engines of Growth
10:04 5. Pivot or Persevere?

TL;DW:

- The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build – that customers want and will pay for - as quickly as possible
- To confirm or reject your hypothesis, experiments must be run to gain validated learning about potential customers. An MVP usually forms the basis of such experiments.
- Three popular types of MVPs are: Video, concierge (cut) and the wizard of Oz
- Every startup should focus on an engine of growth – either the sticky, the viral or the paid one
- Successful entrepreneurship is about perseverance and flexibility at the same time. Pivoting an idea does not equal failure, in fact, almost every successful startup has done a major change to its strategy at some point. 

My goal with this channel is to help you make more money and improve your personal finances. How to become a millionaire? There are many ways to get there – investing in the stock market, becoming a stock trader, doing real estate investing, or why not becoming an entrepreneur? But whether you are interested in how to invest in stocks or investing strategies for creating passive income with rental properties – I hope to be able to provide you with a solution (or at least an idea) here. Warren Buffett - the greatest investor of our time - says that you should fill your mind with competing ideas and then see what makes sense to you. This channel is about filling your mind with those ideas. And in the process – upgrading your money-making toolbox.

### final essay task

This assignment is worth 25% of the course points (graded as A, B, C, D, E, F). It is the only assignment in this course that is graded.

Please make the uploaded file into a PDF-format so it can not be changed during the road.

Your essay should become something like 10-15 pages long, I will not count the words, this is just an indication of size I expect, longer is also ok.

Note that this essay primarily is related to the application of the course book "Stop! Nobody Move" (other assignments concentrates on other parts of the course literature).

Write your essay like this:

1. Pick an idea for a venture. Any idea works, but most logical/simple, would actually be to pick the one you just used in your previous assignment (but it does not have to be that, you can pick another idea).

2. Describe it shortly in the way that you did in previous assignment (if you pick the idea where you already have done this...it does not have to be done again, just pinpoint in the essay that the "basic story/business plan", is already presented by you during the previous assignment).

3. Then apply the "theories" presented in the course book "Stop Nobody Move" towards your idea.

There are 4 main theories presented in the course book Stop Nobody Move: 1. The Rabbit-model (covering the whole book) 2. Disruptive Theory (about how business networks disrupt due to new technologies arriving) 3. Diffusion of Innovation (Incl Adopter Curves). 4. Dynamics of Innovation (how innovation changes character over time).

Your essay is about applying these 4 "theories" in your specific case.

In practice it means that the main parts of your essay will be about answering Qs like:

A. How is future likely to work for, as well as against, your business case of choice, and what do you think you should do about it?

B. Is your case a possible case of Disruption, and can you, if so, use that fact to your own advantage (if so; how)? Or could you make your case into a case of disruption? Or; is the theory of disruption nothing you can have use of in your special case?

C. Where is it likely that you can find your "early adopters", and what could be the reason for them caring about your solution?

D. What is likely to happen in your business context in terms of new possible innovations "popping up" during the road forward, if you would run your case for real?

该作业占课程分数的 25%（评分为 A、B、C、D、E、F）。 这是本课程中唯一评分的作业。

请将上传的文件做成PDF格式，以免途中更改。

你的文章应该有10-15页左右的长度，我不会数字数，这只是我期望的大小的一个指标，更长也可以。

请注意，本文主要与课程书籍“Stop！Nobody Move”的应用相关（其他作业集中在课程文献的其他部分）。

像这样写你的论文：

1. 选择一个创业想法。 任何想法都有效，但最合乎逻辑/简单的是，实际上是选择您刚刚在之前的作业中使用的想法（但不一定是这样，您可以选择另一个想法）。

2. 按照你在之前作业中所做的方式简短地描述它（如果你选择你已经做过这个的想法......它不必再做一次，只需在文章中指出“基本故事/业务” 计划”，您在之前的作业中已经提出过）。

3. 然后将《阻止无人移动》课本中提出的“理论”应用到你的想法中。

《阻止无人移动》课程书中提出了 4 个主要理论： 1. 兔子模型（涵盖整本书） 2. 颠覆性理论（关于业务网络如何因新技术的到来而颠覆） 3. 创新扩散（包括采用者） 曲线）。 4. 创新动力（创新如何随时间改变特征）。

你的文章是关于在你的具体案例中应用这 4 个“理论”。

实际上，这意味着你论文的主要部分将是回答以下问题：

答：未来对您选择的商业案例有何有利或不利，您认为您应该采取什么措施？

B. 您的案件是否可能属于破坏案件？如果是，您能否利用这一事实为自己谋取利益（如果是；如何）？ 或者你可以将你的案例变成破坏案例吗？ 或者; 在您的特殊情况下，颠覆理论是否无法使用？

C. 您在哪里可以找到您的“早期采用者”，他们关心您的解决方案的原因是什么？

D. 如果您真实地运行您的案例，在您的业务环境中，在前进的道路上“突然出现”的新的可能的创新可能会发生什么？
